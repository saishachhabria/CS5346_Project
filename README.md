# CS5346_Project

## Introduction
Migration is often driven by the search for better livelihoods and new opportunities. Indeed, global and regional social and economic inequalities are expressed most powerfully through the figure of the migrant, as one who crosses borders in search of work, education and new horizons.
When it comes to choosing the best country to live in, the answer we come up with might differ from the answers of other people, especially because it all depends on what we are using to define a country as being the best. Whether it’s happiness levels, overall financial stability, type of climate, or something completely unrelated to any of these suggestions, the definition of the number one country to live in is entirely subjective.
Through this project, we intend to help all those who are thinking of moving to another country, or wondering where their current home ranks in the list of living destinations.
Additionally, this project also helps to get perspective on immigration and emigration trends that’s happening around the world and how it has evolved in time. 

## Intended audience
This project is specially meant for young adults (student/professionals)  looking for prospects abroad. It is also useful for people who want to get perspective on the migration trends around the world. The project aims to provide holistic picture of migration trends and country rankings on quality of life.

## Focus metrics
Arguably the most comprehensive and practical analysis of which countries are best to live in depends on an individual's preferences and priorities. We listed top 9 metrics that impact the overall quality of life in a country. We will look into the status of countries through the lens of these metrics. However, we also worked on a design to allow the audience to specify their top priorities and see world ranking of countries on considering only those metrics. The idea is to help individuals find suitable countries based on their preferences in life.
